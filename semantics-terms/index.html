        <h1 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h1>
<h3 id="the-meaningfulness-of-language-is-an-instance-of-the-meaningfulness-of-behaviour">The meaningfulness of language is an instance of the meaningfulness of behaviour</h3>
<p>The meaningfulness of language can be seen as just one instance of the meaningfulness of human behaviour and communication in general, and is one of the systems of structured meaningfulness studied in semiotics.</p>
<h3 id="meaning-is-a-very-vague-term">‘Meaning’ is a very vague term</h3>
<p>‘Meaning’ is a very vague term: in English it refers to a variety of different relations between the world, language and speakers. Most languages do not have precise equivalents for the English term ‘meaning’, and some use a very different stock of lexical resources to talk about meaning-like phenomena.</p>
<h3 id="the-semiotic-triangle">The semiotic triangle</h3>
<p>For the purposes of linguistics, we can isolate three particularly important factors relevant to the study of meaning: the psychology of speakers, which creates and interprets language, the referent of the language expression as projected by the language user’s psychology, and the linguistic expression itself: these three points constitute the semiotic triangle.</p>
<h3 id="lexemes">Lexemes</h3>
<p>In providing a semantic description of a language, we do not need to treat all the variant morphological forms of a single word separately. Instead, we describe the meanings of a language’s lexemes, or the abstract units which unite all the morphological variants of a single word.</p>
<h3 id="sense-reference-denotation-and-connotation">Sense, reference, denotation and connotation</h3>
<p>There are several different aspects of the meaning of a lexeme: its referent on any one occasion of use, its denotation, which is the set of all its referents, and its sense, or the abstract, general meaning which can be translated from one language to another, paraphrased, or defined in a dictionary. Connotation names those aspects of meaning which do not affect a word’s sense, reference or denotation, but which have to do with secondary factors such as its emotional force, its level of formality, its character as a euphemism, etc.</p>
<h3 id="compositionality">Compositionality</h3>
<p>Meaning is often compositional, which means that the meanings of sentences are made up, or composed, of the meanings of their constituent lexemes.</p>
<h3 id="sentence-and-utterance-meaning">Sentence and utterance meaning</h3>
<p>Sentence meaning is the compositional meaning of the sentence as constructed out of the meanings of its individual component lexemes. Utterance meaning is the meaning which the words have on a particular occasion of use in the particular context in which they occur. Semantics studies sentence meaning, whereas pragmatics studies utterance meaning and other aspects of language use.</p>
<h3 id="object-language-and-metalanguage">Object language and metalanguage</h3>
<p>In analysing meaning we distinguish the object language, or the language whose meanings are being described, from the metalanguage, the language in which we describe these meanings.</p>
<h3 id="explanations-of-meaning-in-terms-of-meanings-are-circular">Explanations of meaning in terms of meanings are circular</h3>
<p>When we propose a definition in a metalanguage as an analysis of the meaning of an object language term, the more basic questions, ‘what is meaning?’ and ‘what is it to understand a meaning?’ are left unanswered. All definitions of meaning in language, therefore, are ultimately circular because they use one kind of meaning to explain another.</p>
<h3 id="four-ways-of-breaking-the-circle">Four ways of breaking the circle</h3>
<p>　There are four important answers to the question ‘what is meaning?’: the referential/denotational theory of meaning, the conceptual theory of meaning, the brain states theory and the use theory. We do not have to categorically choose between these theories. Instead, recognizing that the notion of meaning in linguistics is a way of talking about the factors which explain language use, we can see referents, concepts, brain states and uses as all relevant to this task.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h1>
<h3 id="meaning-definition-and-the-mental-lexicon">Meaning, definition and the mental lexicon</h3>
<p>The concept of a word’s meaning is closely linked to the concept of definition. Many linguists identify the task of linguistic semantics with the task of describing the entries stored in the mental lexicon, a stock of words and meanings stored in long-term memory: the definition</p>
<p>of a word is part of its entry in the mental lexicon, and the process of matching a meaning with a word-form is assumed to be analogous to that involved in consulting a dictionary. In order to serve the purposes of serious linguistic description, the definitions in the lexicon must be much more detailed than is usual in ordinary dictionaries.</p>
<h3 id="what-units-need-to-receive-definition">What units need to receive definition?</h3>
<p>Any attempt to analyse the meanings of language must specify what the meaning-bearing units are. Individual lexemes are the central examples of units with individually describable meanings. Morphemes also have meanings, as do phrasal verbs and compounds.</p>
<p>　Ambiguities about the level of grammatical structure to which meaning is correctly attributed are not infrequent: sound symbolism and idioms exemplify cases where the correct level for the analysis of a meaning may not be clear.</p>
<h3 id="real-and-nominal-definition">Real and nominal definition</h3>
<h3 id="we-can-distinguish-two-types-of-definition">We can distinguish two types of definition:</h3>
<p>definition of the essence of a thing (real definition), or definition of the meaning of a word (nominal definition).</p>
<p>Most linguists take nominal definition to be the type that is of interest to linguistic semantic research.</p>
<h3 id="cognitive-and-extensional-definition">Cognitive and extensional definition</h3>
<p>A nominal definition may be of two types:</p>
<p>cognitive (aimed to inculcate an understanding of the word’s correct use), or extensional (aimed at delimiting the denotation of the word).</p>
<p>​</p>
<h1 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h1>
<h3 id="the-basic-question-meaning-and-context">The basic question: meaning and context</h3>
<p>One of the main questions to be answered by any theory of meaning concerns the scope of an expression’s meaning: how much of the total effect of an expression is to be attributed to its meaning, and how much to the context in which it occurs?</p>
<p>We can distinguish two essential types of context:</p>
<p>the external or real-world context to which linguistic expressions refer, and the interpersonal context of linguistic action in which any utterance is placed.</p>
<h3 id="external-context-sense-and-reference">External context: sense and reference</h3>
<p>Frege distinguished an expression’s reference, which concerns the entities which the expression is about, from its sense, which is the way in which we grasp or understand its referent. In the Fregean view, two crucial features of sense are as follows:</p>
<p>sense is what our minds ‘grasp’ when we understand the meaning of a word; sense determines reference; words’ referents are identified through their senses.</p>
<p>Truth has a central place in Frege’s semantics. To know the sense of a sentence is, for Frege, to know how the sentence could be assigned a value as true or false: to know what the conditions are that would make it true or false. Knowledge of a sentence’s truth conditions allows us to determine, by looking at the sentence’s referents, whether the world actually is the way the sentence represents it, and thus whether or not the sentence is therefore true.</p>
<h3 id="predication-and-deixis">Predication and deixis</h3>
<p>As well as referring, linguistic expressions can often be used to predicate (attribute properties). Verbs, for example, are characteristically limited to this function. Deictic expressions (otherwise known as deictics or indexicals) are defined as those which make reference to some aspect of the context of utterance as an essential part of their meaning. Examples of deictics in English include the words I, you and here. The languages of the world show a large variety of deictic systems.</p>
<h3 id="knowledge-of-meaning-and-knowledge-of-facts">Knowledge of meaning and knowledge of facts</h3>
<p>Since reference is an important part of the meaning of many words, many linguists have wanted to distinguish knowledge we have of a word’s meaning (sense) from knowledge we might have about its referent. This is the distinction between lexical (‘dictionary’) knowledge and factual (‘encyclopaedic’) knowledge.</p>
<p>　The distinction enables an economical description of word meanings, but is often criticized: the boundary between dictionary and encyclopaedia seems to be so highly permeable as to be nonexistent.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h1>
<h3 id="interpersonal-context">Interpersonal context</h3>
<p>The relations between language and context are not limited to those in which a linguistic expression describes a preexisting world. The assertion of facts about the world is just one of the acts which we can use language to perform: we also ask questions, issue orders and make requests. In these types of speech act, truth is not a relevant parameter in the appreciation of meaning.</p>
<h3 id="austin-and-searle-on-speech-acts">Austin and Searle on speech acts</h3>
<p>Austin’s theory of speech acts distinguished three types of act we perform in any utterance:</p>
<p>the locutionary act is the act of saying something, i.e. the act of expressing the basic, literal meanings of the words chosen</p>
<p>the illocutionary act is the act performed in saying something, i.e. the act of using words to achieve such goals as warning, promising, guaranteeing, etc.</p>
<p>the perlocutionary act is the act performed by saying something, i.e. the act of producing an effect in the hearer by means of the utterance.</p>
<p>Considerations of truth and falsity are simply irrelevant for many types of illocutionary act. Austin distinguished constative utterances like snow is white, which have the illocutionary force of simply stating something, from performative utterances like I apologize, which themselves bring about the state of affairs they mention. Fregean truth conditions are relevant to constatives but not to performatives. Instead of truth conditions, performative utterances have felicity conditions. Typical felicity conditions for many types of constative and performative utterance were described by Searle.</p>
<h3 id="grice-on-implicature">Grice on implicature</h3>
<p>Grice recast the study of the relations between language and context by highlighting the central role of intention to meaning, and developed a theory of implicature and conversational maxims which described the relation between sentence and utterance (speaker) meaning. Grice’s main contribution is the four conversational maxims of Quality, Quantity, Manner and Relevance. Many implied meanings result from speakers’ deliberate infringement of these maxims.</p>
<h3 id="relevance-theory">Relevance theory</h3>
<p>Relevance Theory, finally, represents a third tradition which challenges some of the central presuppositions of the study of meaning. According to Relevance Theorists, the production and understanding of utterances is explained as the result of a universal comprehension procedure which consists in selecting the most relevant aspects of a word’s meaning in a given situation. There is no distinction between literal and non-literal meaning, and what meanings are activated by a word is highly dependent on the particular context in which it is uttered.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h1>
<p>As well as knowing a word’s definitional meaning, a competent speaker knows how it relates to other words of the language. Five important types of lexical relation have been identified.</p>
<h3 id="antonymy">Antonymy</h3>
<p>Antonymy (oppositeness) may be characterized as a relationship of incompatibility between two terms with respect to some given dimension of contrast. The principal distinction to be made in discussion of antonymy is between gradable (e.g. hot–cold) and non-gradable (e.g. married–unmarried) antonyms, i.e. antonyms which do and do not admit a midpoint.</p>
<h3 id="meronymy">Meronymy</h3>
<p>Meronymy is the relation of part to whole: hand is a meronym of arm, seed is a meronym of fruit, blade is a meronym of knife. Not all languages seem to have an unambiguous means of lexicalizing the concept PART OF, but meronymy is often at the origin of various polysemy patterns in languages.</p>
<h3 id="hyponymy-and-taxonomy">Hyponymy and taxonomy</h3>
<p>Hyponymy and taxonomy (kind of-ness) define different types of class-inclusion hierarchies; hyponymy is an important structural principle in many languages with classifiers, while taxonomy has been argued to be basic to the classification and naming of biological species.</p>
<h3 id="synonymy">Synonymy</h3>
<p>Synonymy is frequently claimed to exist between different expressions of the same language, but genuine lexical synonyms prove extremely hard to find: once their combinatorial environments have been fully explored, proposed lexical synonyms often prove not to be such.</p>
<h3 id="componential-analysis">Componential analysis</h3>
<p>The importance of appreciating a lexeme’s semantic relations in order to understand its meaning is one of the motivations for a componential approach to semantic analysis. Componential analysis analyses meaning in terms of binary features (i.e. features with only two possible values, + or –), and represents a translation into semantics of the principles of structuralist phonological analysis. As a type of definitional analysis, componential analysis inherits the failings of traditional</p>
<p>definitions, and words for which it proves hard to couch definitions are also hard to analyse componentially.</p>
<h3 id="polysemy-and-monosemy">Polysemy and monosemy</h3>
<p>Theoretical and ordinary description of meaning would both be impossible without the recognition of separate senses within the same word. Words with several related senses are described as polysemous. Polysemy contrasts simultaneously with monosemy, the case where a word has a single meaning, and homonymy, the case where two unrelated words happen to share the same phonological form. In spite of the intuitive obviousness of these distinctions, there are many instances where it is not clear whether a word should be analysed as polysemous or monosemous, and no absolute criteria have ever been proposed which will successfully discriminate them.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h1>
<h3 id="the-nature-and-importance-of-logic">The nature and importance of logic</h3>
<p>Logic investigates the properties of valid arguments and chains of reasoning, and specifies the conditions which arguments must meet in order to be valid. It is important to linguists for three principal reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it constitutes one of the oldest and most developed traditions of the study of meaning</p></li>
<li><p>it is at the heart of formal and computational theories of semantics</p></li>
<li><p>certain logical concepts, like ¬ or ), provide an interesting point of contrast with their natural language equivalents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="logical-form-validity-and-soundness">Logical form, validity and soundness</h3>
<p>Logic analyses the underlying logical structure of arguments, known as their logical form. This is independent of the way in which the argument happens to be phrased in any given language. We distinguished between valid and sound arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Valid arguments are ones in which, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.</p></li>
<li><p>Sound arguments are valid arguments which have true premises.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="propositional-logic">Propositional logic</h3>
<p>　Propositional logic is the branch of logic that studies relations between propositions. A proposition is something which serves as the premise or conclusion of an argument. In propositional logic, special importance is given to the four propositional connectives or operators not, and, or and if . . . then. These connectives are truth-functional. This means that whether the propositions to which they are added are true or not depends solely on the truth of the original propositions. The values or meanings of the operators can be specified in the form of truth tables, which display the way in which logical connectives affect the truth of the propositions in which they appear.</p>
<h3 id="logic-as-representation-and-as-perfection-of-meaning">Logic as representation and as perfection of meaning</h3>
<p>The truth-functional definitions of the propositional connectives are quite often counterintuitive and unnatural. None of the operators corresponds perfectly with any English equivalent. The clash between the meanings of the logical connectives and their ordinary language equivalents reveals a contrast between two different interpretations of the nature of logic: logic as a representation and as a perfection of meaning.</p>
<h3 id="predicate-logic">Predicate logic</h3>
<p>‘Some’ and ‘all’ are the basic notions of predicate logic. Predicate logic studies the logical form of propositions involving three kinds of expression:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>singular terms or individual constants, which refer to individuals (whether things or people). Singular terms are symbolized by lower case letters.</p></li>
<li><p>predicates, which represent properties or relations, such as ‘primate’, ‘hairy’ or ‘adore’. Predicates are symbolized by upper case letters.</p></li>
<li><p>quantifiers, like ‘some’ ( ) and ‘all’ ( ).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>　Predicates have a certain number of arguments. An argument is the individual or individuals to which the property or relation expressed by the predicate is attributed.</p>
<p>　　is called the existential quantifier. ( x) is read as ‘there is at least one x, such that’. is called the universal quantifier. ( x) is read ‘for every x, it is the case that’. Quantification may be single or multiple. A singly quantified proposition contains only a single quantifier. A multiply quantified proposition contains several. Propositions with both the universal and the existential quantifiers allow for the disambiguation of sentences like everyone loves someone.</p>
<h3 id="reference-truth-and-models">Reference, truth and models</h3>
<p>For logical approaches to semantics, reference and truth are the principal semantic facts: the most important thing about the meaning of a word is what it refers to, and the most important thing about a sentence is whether or not it is true. The model of a set of logical formulae is a set of statements showing what each expression of the formula refers to in some possible world (6.5). The referent of a logical expression is called its extension:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The extension of an individual constant (singular term) is simply the individual entity which the constant picks out.</p></li>
<li><p>The extension of a one-place predicate is the entire set of individuals to which the predicate applies. The predicate ‘tall’, for instance, applies to all tall entities.</p></li>
<li><p>The extension of a two-place predicate like ‘respect’ will be the set of all pairs of individuals such that the first respects the second.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, we can say that the extension of an n-place predicate is an ordered n-tuple of entities.</p>
<h3 id="relations-between-propositions">Relations between propositions</h3>
<p>Entailment is the relation between propositions where the truth of the first guarantees the truth of the second. Presupposition is the relation between two propositions p and q, such that both p and ¬p entail q. A contradictory is a pair of propositions which always have opposite truth values. Pairs of propositions which cannot both be true but can both be false are called contraries. Pairs of propositions which cannot be simultaneously false, but can be simultaneously true are called subcontraries.</p>
<h3 id="meaning-postulates">Meaning postulates</h3>
<p>The theory of meaning postulates uses logical notions to describe the relations which a word has with other members of the same vocabulary, and constitutes a possible alternative to the decompositional modes of meaning analysis.</p>
<h3 id="russell-on-definite-descriptions">Russell on definite descriptions</h3>
<p>Russell’s theory of definite descriptions offers an analysis in logical terms of the meaning of propositions involving the English determiner the, according to which such propositions contain disguised quantifications.</p>
<h3 id="is-logic-relevant-to-the-semantics-of-natural-language">Is logic relevant to the semantics of natural language?</h3>
<p>In the course of the chapter we saw a number of reasons to doubt that logical tools provide an appropriate model of the meanings involved in natural language. These include: - the existence of incompatibilities between logical operators and their natural language equivalents</p>
<ul>
<li>the orientation of logic to reference and truth, which are only some of the considerations relevant to natural language.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, many linguists in favour of logical approaches to semantics would claim that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>in its attention to declarative sentences a logical approach promises a formalization of an important subset of natural language sentences, and that</p></li>
<li><p>a logical approach permits a degree of rigour and formalization which entirely outstrips that of the more descriptive approaches to meaning.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h1>
<h3 id="two-views-of-categorization">Two views of categorization</h3>
<p>Categorization is a fundamental psychological process: the human mind can class different things in the world in the same category, and denote them with a single term. Since words can be seen as the names of categories, categorization has been a major focus of investigations of word meaning. Linguists and psychologists typically contrast two views of categorization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the classical view, on which membership of a given category is an either-or property, with no in-between cases. For example, on the classical view, something either is or is not a flower, or a lie, or red.</p></li>
<li><p>the prototype view, on which a category is structured in terms of a central tendency. On this view, categories like FLOWER, LIE or RED each have more and less central (prototypical) members.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problems-with-classical-categorization">Problems with classical categorization</h3>
<p>The classical view of categorization is rejected by many semanticists since it seems unable to account for basic semantic phenomena, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are categories in which some members are better exemplars of the category than others.</p></li>
<li><p>There are categories in which the boundaries of membership are not clearcut: it is not always possible to say whether or not something is a member of the category.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problems-with-prototype-categorization">Problems with prototype categorization</h3>
<p>The prototype view is certainly able to account for these facts, but is open to several questions and problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>how do we identify the relevant attributes in a category?</p></li>
<li><p>how can we account for the boundaries of prototype categories?</p></li>
<li><p>how much of the vocabulary is structured according to prototype categories? - prototype semantics may simply absolve the semanticist from the serious effort of lexical description</p></li>
<li><p>the evidence for prototypes may be metalinguistic in nature</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cognitivist-approaches-to-semantics">Cognitivist approaches to semantics</h3>
<p>Cognitivist approaches to semantics are directly inspired by prototype theory. These approaches have four important commitments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an identification between meaning and conceptual structure</p></li>
<li><p>a rejection of the syntax–semantics distinction</p></li>
<li><p>a rejection of the semantics–pragmatics distinction</p></li>
<li><p>a rejection of a modular approach to language</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="icms-and-image-schemas">ICMs and image schemas</h3>
<p>A central notion in cognitive semantics is that linguistic meaning depends on encyclopaedic knowledge structures stored in long-term memory. Lakoff (1987) calls these idealized cognitive models (ICMs), and sees prototype effects as explained by them. ICMs can be thought of as theories of particular subjects – the implicit knowledge we have about the objects, relations and processes named in language. The knowledge structures typically involve image schemas, such as CONTAINMENT, SOURCE-PATH-GOAL, FORCE, BALANCE and so on. These are organizing structures of our experience and understanding at the level of bodily perception and movement. They are usually represented diagrammatically. Image schemas are particularly useful as representations of the meanings of prepositions.</p>
<h3 id="metaphor">Metaphor</h3>
<p>Metaphor is stressed in much cognitive semantics as an inherent aspect of language structure. Cognitive semantics shows that metaphor is not the exception in language: metaphorical ways of talking are just as widespread as ‘literal’ ones. The normal way of referring to many domains of meaning, such as that of obligation in English, is metaphorical. Lakoff and Johnson’s conceptual theory of metaphor proposes that metaphor is a cognitive process which helps us to conceptualize our experience by setting up correspondences between easily understood things like burdens and hard to understand things like obligations. A metaphorical mapping allows knowledge about the metaphor’s source or vehicle domain (burdens) to be applied to the target (obligations) in a way that fundamentally determines or influences the conceptualization of the target.</p>
<h3 id="metonymy">Metonymy</h3>
<p>Another important cognitive process is metonymy: the concepts related by a metonymy can be understood as contiguous to (neighbouring) each other, either conceptually or in the real world.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-extension-and-radial-categories">Semantic extension and radial categories</h3>
<p>Metaphor and metonymy constitute the principal mechanisms of semantic extension, as seen in expressions like head of a queue, head of cattle and so on. This type of structure, where there is a central case and conventionalized variations on it which cannot be predicted by general rules, is called a radial structure. For head, the central case is represented by uses consistent with the ICM described above, and the variations are the metaphoric and metonymic extensions.</p>
<h3 id="problems-with-cognitive-semantics">Problems with cognitive semantics</h3>
<p>Cognitive approaches to semantics have proven very popular, but can be criticized for three main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the ambiguity of diagrammatic representations</p></li>
<li><p>the problem of determining a lexical item’s core meaning, and</p></li>
<li><p>the indeterminate and speculative nature of the analyses.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h1>
<h3 id="jackendoff-conceptual-semantics">Jackendoff: Conceptual Semantics</h3>
<p>Jackendoff’s Conceptual Semantics shares with cognitive semantics a commitment to analysing meaning as inherently linked to conceptualization. Its most important difference from cognitive semantics is that it uses a formalism.</p>
<h3 id="decomposition-and-conceptual-primitives">Decomposition and conceptual primitives</h3>
<p>Jackendoff claims that a decompositional method is necessary to explore conceptual structure, in which the concepts underlying word meaning are broken down into their smallest elements: conceptual primitives envisaged as the semantic equivalents of phonological features. Conceptual Semantics posits ‘a finite set of mental primitives and a finite set of principles of mental combination’ governing their interaction. The conceptual structure of a lexical item is an element with zero or more open argument slots, which are filled by the syntactic complements of the lexical item. Jackendoff’s system permits interesting connections to be made between apparently unrelated meanings, but can be criticized for the apparently somewhat arbitrary nature of the conceptual constituents it recognizes.</p>
<h3 id="modelling-meaning-computationally">Modelling meaning computationally</h3>
<p>Computers come closer than any other artificial system to matching the complexity and interconnectedness of the human brain, and it has often been assumed that the attempt to simulate human linguistic ability computationally will teach us important lessons about the way language is processed in real-life minds/brains. This is particularly true of studies of words and their meanings, though it is important not to push the mind–computer analogy too far.</p>
<h3 id="wordnet-and-the-lexicon">WordNet and the lexicon</h3>
<p>The most comprehensive attempt to model lexical knowledge on a computer is WordNet, an online lexical database which sets out to represent and organize lexical semantic information in a psychologically realistic form that facilitates maximally efficient digital manipulation. The main organizational unit in WordNet is the synset. Synsets are groupings of near-synonyms, arranged into hyponymic/taxonomic trees called inheritance hierarchies. Each term in an inheritance hierarchy ‘inherits’ the information associated with its hypernyms: this gives the user immediate access to the full range of information associated with a lexical item.</p>
<h3 id="word-sense-disambiguation">Word sense disambiguation</h3>
<p>One of the hardest problems in computer simulations of natural language processing is the problem of word-sense disambiguation. Computers must know how to distinguish between the different senses of ambiguous words like bank if they are to be able to process language correctly. We discussed two main approaches to this task:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>selectional restriction approaches, which use selectional restrictions to weed out improperly formed semantic representations; and</p></li>
<li><p>the contextual approach, in which the computer assesses the words surrounding the target word, and chooses the appropriate sense on the basis of the other words in this immediate context.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both approaches are in their infancy and programs using them significantly underperform humans.</p>
<h3 id="pustejovsky-and-qualia-structure">Pustejovsky and qualia structure</h3>
<p>　Pustejovsky attempts to solve a number of problems in word-sense disambiguation by proposing a richer structure for nominal entries in the lexicon. He claims that the meaning of nouns is best modelled by the notion of qualia structure. A noun’s qualia structure consists of four roles, the constitutive, formal, telic and agentive roles. The key element of Pustejovsky’s theory is that each of these roles can operate independently within the semantics of a clause. For example, we know that a fast car is one that moves quickly, and a fast motorway is one on which cars can move quickly, since fast applies to the telic role of the noun: the role that refers to the function or purpose which the referent fulfils.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h1>
<h3 id="what-parts-of-speech-a-language-has-is-a-matter-of-interpretation">What parts of speech a language has is a matter of interpretation</h3>
<p>There are usually several different plausible interpretations of the part of speech categories (lexical categories, grammatical categories) of any language.</p>
<h3 id="morphological-and-distributional-criteria-for-parts-of-speech">Morphological and distributional criteria for parts of speech</h3>
<p>Some languages have clear morphological criteria for assigning words to parts of speech: we can divide up the classes on the basis of what affixes they appear with. In languages without clear morphology, a distributional approach to parts of speech can sometimes be used to classify parts of speech on the basis of the way they pattern in sentences. Both morphological and distributional methods for part of speech classification are unreliable. In any case, both presuppose a preexisting decision about how the parts of speech are to be defined.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-definitions-of-parts-of-speech">Semantic definitions of parts of speech</h3>
<p>The same problem affects semantic definitions of parts of speech: we cannot appeal to thingness, eventhood and so on as criteria for grammatical category, since they are not known independently of the very grammatical features which they are supposed to establish.</p>
<h3 id="multicategoriality">Multicategoriality</h3>
<p>Many languages show widespread multicategoriality (roots which may appear as different parts of speech). We can think of nouns and verbs as ‘slots’ or contexts available in each clause, each of which comes associated with the appropriate grammatical machinery. The grammatical slots themselves can be seen as the carriers of the nounhood or verbhood which the word ends up acquiring.</p>
<h3 id="hopper-and-thompson-parts-of-speech-and-discourse-function">Hopper and Thompson: parts of speech and discourse function</h3>
<p>Hopper and Thompson suggest that parts of speech can be understood as prototype categories defined by their discourse functions. The difference in the grammatical options available to a given occurrence of a noun or verb correlates with its discourse function in a given context – the closer the noun or verb is to playing its prototypical discourse role, the closer it comes to exhibiting the full range of grammatical possibilities of its class. It is open to question whether the discourse function definition of parts of speech is any less problematic than the semantic definitions it replaces.</p>
<h3 id="tense">Tense</h3>
<p>Tense is the name of the class of grammatical markers used to signal the location of situations in time. Three basic temporal divisions are relevant to the representation of time in language: what is happening now, what will happen afterwards, and what has already happened. Some languages display a three-way division between past, present and future, with each tense marked separately on the verb. Others have a two-way distinction; either between past and non-past, or (more rarely) future and non-future. Perfect tenses are often described in terms of relevance to the speech situation, but this definition is problematic.</p>
<h3 id="aspect">Aspect</h3>
<p>Aspect is the grammatical category which expresses differences in the way time is presented in events. Aspectual categories express the internal temporal constituency of an event; whether the event is viewed from the distance, as a single unanalysable whole (perfective aspect), or from closeup, so that the distinct stages of the event can be seen individually (imperfective aspect). The perfective/imperfective distinction has nothing to do with the actual nature of the event, but is all about how the event is construed by the speaker. In particular, it is independent of the actual duration of the event in question.</p>
<h3 id="tense-is-deictic-aspect-isnt">Tense is deictic, aspect isn’t</h3>
<p>A major difference between tense and aspect is that tense is deictic and aspect isn’t.</p>
<p>　The particular time reference of any tense therefore has to be anchored deictically in the moment of utterance.</p>
<h3 id="aktionsart">Aktionsart</h3>
<p>Aktionsart is the term for an event’s inherent aspectual classification.</p>
<h3 id="many-researchers-claim-that-events-can-be-classified-into-five-basic">Many researchers claim that events can be classified into five basic</h3>
<p>Aktionsart classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>states</p></li>
<li><p>activities</p></li>
<li><p>accomplishments</p></li>
<li><p>achievements, and</p></li>
<li><p>semelfactives</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These classes show significant interaction effects with perfective and imperfective meanings. The five Aktionsart classes can be summarized along the dimensions of whether they are static (whether they refer to unchanging states or to occurrences), telicity (whether they have an inherent endpoint) and punctuality (whether they are conceived of as consisting of internal temporal parts):</p>
<p>State [+static], [−telic], [−punctual]</p>
<p>Activity [−static], [−telic], [−punctual]</p>
<p>Achievement [−static], [+telic], [+punctual]</p>
<p>Accomplishment [−static], [+telic], [−punctual]</p>
<p>Semelfactive [−static], [−telic], [+punctual]</p>
<h3 id="the-internal-structure-of-achievements">The internal structure of achievements</h3>
<p>Botne showed that achievement verbs have a more complex temporal-ity than was originally assumed. What is punctual about achievement verbs like find, die, notice, or recognize is their nucleus; in addition to this nucleus, a verb may contain a preceding onset phase or a subsequent coda phase. Languages differ in the temporal phases surrounding the central nucleus.</p>
<h3 id="tense-and-aspect-less-languages">Tense and aspect-less languages</h3>
<p>Some languages lack any grammatical means of expressing tense– aspect contrasts. In such languages, the relevant contrasts will be achieved through non-grammatical (lexical and pragmatic) means. The complete absence of grammatical coding of tense and aspect is not uncommon in the languages of the world.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h1>
<h3 id="the-linking-problem">The linking problem</h3>
<p>The linking problem is the problem of accounting for the relations between a verb and its associated noun phrases. According to the traditional generative understanding, the lexical entries for verbs include a specification of the types of argument they have associated with them. It was assumed that the possible arguments of all verbs could be classified into a small number of classes, called thematic roles, theta-roles, participant roles or semantic roles. Typical roles include agent, patient/ theme, goal, source, location, instrument, beneficiary and experiencer. Some roles are more likely to be coded as subject, and others as object. It was suggested that it is possible to rank the different roles in an order which shows their relative accessibility to subject position.</p>
<h3 id="problems-with-thematic-roles">Problems with thematic roles</h3>
<p>There are three main problems with thematic roles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The arguments of many verbs seem hard to assign to any of the conventional thematic roles.</p></li>
<li><p>There are also many occasions where an argument could be assigned to several thematic roles.</p></li>
<li><p>It has not proven possible to formulate a universal thematic hierarchy ranking these roles.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proto-roles">Proto-roles</h3>
<p>Dowty (1991) suggested that the different participant roles are cluster concepts, like Roschean prototypes, and that thematic roles are based on entailments of verb-meanings. The argument with the most Proto-Agent entailments will be coded as subject, and the one with the most Proto-Patient entailments as object.</p>
<h3 id="thematic-roles-and-conceptual-structure">Thematic roles and conceptual structure</h3>
<p>Jackendoff’s theory of semantic representation dispenses completely with theta-roles, and derives argument structure directly from the semantics of the verb. This means that the thematic hierarchy can be completely restated in terms of underlying conceptual configurations. In Jackendoff’s theory of conceptual structure, selectional restrictions are also specified directly by the conceptual structure: they are not extra information which needs to be learnt in addition to the meaning of the verbs themselves.</p>
<h3 id="verb-classes-and-alternations">Verb classes and alternations</h3>
<p>Many verbs show several different argument structures. These different types of argument structure are known as alternations. They include the causative, middle, resultative, conative and others. Levin and Hovav proposed that which alternations a verb participates in is explained by its underlying semantic structure. On their theory, verbs fall into semantically defined classes, which all show similar syntactic behaviour with respect to their alternations.</p>
<h3 id="the-meaning-of-constructions">The meaning of constructions</h3>
<p>Words are not the only meaning-bearing units in grammar. Semantic representations are also associated with constructions. Goldberg put forward a constructional account of the syntax–semantics interface, in which arguments can be subcategorized by the construction itself. Not all verbs can appear in all constructions. A verb’s meaning determines whether it is compatible with a given construction. The constructional account reduces the proliferation of verb-senses.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h1>
<h3 id="diachronic-and-cross-linguistic-meaning-comparison-presupposes-a-correct-metalanguage">Diachronic and cross-linguistic meaning comparison presupposes a correct metalanguage</h3>
<p>Claims about the variation or change of given meanings necessitate a particular metalanguage in which the meanings can be described, a situation which immediately introduces complications since there is not yet any agreement about what the correct metalanguage for semantic description is. Linguistics in general, and semantic theory in particular, assume that languages are mutually translatable in a way that preserves important meaning components.</p>
<h3 id="importance-of-polysemy-in-meaning-change">Importance of polysemy in meaning change</h3>
<p>　Meaning change crucially involves polysemy. A word does not suddenly change from meaning A to meaning B in a single move; instead, the change happens via an intermediate stage in which the word has both A and B among its meanings.</p>
<h3 id="the-traditional-classification-of-semantic-change">The traditional classification of semantic change</h3>
<p>The traditional classification of semantic change recognized the following six types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Specialization (narrowing), in which a word narrows its range of reference</p></li>
<li><p>Generalization (broadening), in which a word’s meaning changes to encompass a wider class of referents</p></li>
<li><p>Pejorization, in which a word takes on a meaning with a less favourable evaluative force</p></li>
<li><p>Ameliorization, in which a word takes on a meaning with a more favourable evaluative force</p></li>
<li><p>Metonymy, the process of sense-extension in which a word shifts to a contiguous meaning</p></li>
<li><p>Metaphor, changes based on similarity or analogy</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conventionalization-of-implicature">Conventionalization of implicature</h3>
<p>Much modern work on semantic change examines pathways and regularities of semantic change, stressing the role of the conventionalization of implicature. This is the theory that semantic change occurs through the progressive strengthening of the implicatures of expressions in particular contexts, until the implicated meaning becomes part of the expression’s literal meaning. These explanations can supersede ones based on the traditional categories.</p>
<h3 id="subjectification">Subjectification</h3>
<p>　An important tendency in semantic change is subjectification. This is the tendency for meanings to ‘become increasingly based in the speaker’s subjective belief state/attitude toward the proposition’.</p>
<p>　 Perception verbs and the mind-as-body metaphor</p>
<p>Viberg (1984) found a strong cross-linguistic hierarchy governed the polysemies of perception verbs. The visual modality of perception is always the source but never the target of processes of polysemy. The mind-as-body metaphor is a possible explanation of the extension of ‘see’ verbs to ‘know/understand’ in Indo-European languages, but is not universal: many languages draw their ‘know’ verb from verbs for hearing.</p>
<h3 id="grammaticalization">Grammaticalization</h3>
<p>One particular context for semantic change is grammaticalization, the process by which open-class content words turn into closed-class function forms. They do this by losing elements of their meaning, and by a restriction in their possible grammatical contexts. Study of these processes has revealed a number of regular pathways which recur again and again in the world’s languages linking particular open-class lexemes with particular grammaticalized functions.</p>
<h3 id="corpus-studies-of-meaning-variation">Corpus studies of meaning variation</h3>
<p>The seeds of semantic change are found in synchronic meaning variation in everyday discourse. Corpora are useful for semantic analysis because they can reveal unsuspected patterns of collocation (regular word combination). Many words cluster in predictable collocational patterns. Studies of collocation can give surprising results: for example, corpus investigation reveals that cause is not used neutrally, but has a strong tendency to be associated with negative events.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-typology">Semantic typology</h3>
<p>Because of the problems of determining universals of sense, semantic typology concentrates on the question of cross-linguistic regularities in denotation or extension (11.4).</p>
<h3 id="typology-of-body-part-reference">Typology of body-part reference</h3>
<p>The human body is a basic and universal aspect of our experience, but there are remarkably few cross-linguistic generalizations that hold about the semantics of body-part terms.</p>
<h3 id="typology-of-colour-reference">Typology of colour-reference</h3>
<p>Colour terms have been an important site of cross-linguistic investigation. Berlin and Kay hypothesized that each language has a set of basic colour terms (BCTs). Basic colour terms in all languages target a restricted range of colours, but the boundaries between these targets vary widely. The number of BCTs in a language makes it possible to predict exactly what the basic colour terms are, and Berlin and Kay proposed seven types of language, classified according to the number of BCTs. Berlin and Kay’s findings have been broadly confirmed, but</p>
<p>there are some significant counterexamples to their typology, as well as fundamental criticisms of their methodology which cast doubt on the significance of their approach.</p>
<h3 id="deictic-motion-typology">Deictic motion typology</h3>
<p>Meanings in the domain of deictic motion, the actions expressed in</p>
<p>English as ‘coming’ and ‘going’, also vary widely cross-linguistically.</p>
<h3 id="typology-of-motion-path-and-manner-lexicalization">Typology of motion, path and manner lexicalization</h3>
<p>　Talmy (1985) compared how different languages lexicalize the four elements of motion, path, figure and manner in motion verbs. Talmy proposed a major typological division between verb-framed and satellite-framed languages. In verb-framed languages the path component is lexicalized in the verb root itself. In satellite-framed languages it is lexicalized in a satellite element. As well as verb- and satellite-framed languages, some linguists claim that there is a third type, equipollent languages, in which both path and manner are treated in the same way. Talmy’s typology has been widely discussed, and the distinction between verb- and satellite-framing is often invoked as a way of characterizing how different languages distribute motion information in the clause. It has been challenged, however, on the grounds that it artificially targets an abstract motion component in verbs whose meaning is actually much less abstract.</p>
<h3 id="the-typology-of-spatial-reference">The typology of spatial reference</h3>
<p>A frame of reference is ‘the internally consistent system of projecting regions of space onto a figure-ground relationship in order to establish specification of location’ (Pederson et al. 1998: 571). Languages with a relative frame of reference use spatial expressions with meanings like ‘in front of me/behind me’ and ‘to my left/right’. Other languages contain an absolute frame of reference. This is a system of spatial location which does not depend on the position of a speech participant, but is anchored instead in unchanging features of the geography, like uphill/ downhill distinctions, or in the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west). The least common frame of reference in the languages of the world is the intrinsic frame of reference. This system only makes reference to intrinsic features of figure and ground: ‘the man is at the side of the tree, the tree is at the chest/face/back of the man’ and so on.</p>
<h3 id="the-relation-of-language-and-thought">The relation of language and thought</h3>
<p>Differences in semantic typology raise the question of the influence between language and thought. Whorf believed that the grammatical categories of one’s language determine the categories of broader cognition. This idea is known as linguistic determinism or the linguistic relativity hypothesis. Thinking in general must be distinguished from thinking for speaking. The grammatical categories of a language must determine thinking for speaking. The interesting question is whether they also determine general cognition. Research has found a statistically very highly reliable correlation between the prevailing frame of spatial reference used in a language and the types of response in non-linguistic cognitive tasks. These suggest a limited influence of language on general cognition. There are many other domains, however, where such an effect is not observed.</p>
