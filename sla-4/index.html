        <h1 id="theories">Theories</h1>
<h3 id="critical-period-hypothesis">Critical Period Hypothesis</h3>
<p>There is a specific and limited period for language acquisition. The language acquisition device, like other biological functions, works successfully only when it is stimulated at the right time called “critical period”.</p>
<h3 id="behaviorist-perspective">Behaviorist perspective</h3>
<p>Language learning is the result of imitation, practice, feedback on success, and habit formation. They view imitation and practice as primary processes in language development.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-logical-problem-of-language-acquisition">What is the “logical problem” of language acquisition?</h3>
<p>The question of how children achieve the final state of L1 development with ease and success when the linguistic system is very complex and their cognitive ability is not fully developed. Children come to know more about the structure of their language than they could reasonably be expected to learn on the basis of the samples of language they hear.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-contrastive-analysis-what-are-its-limitations">What is contrastive analysis? What are its limitations?</h3>
<p>Contrastive Analysis (CA) is an approach to the study of SLA which involves predicting and explaining learner problems based on a comparison of L1 and L2 to determine similarities and differences, influenced by Structuralism and Behaviorism.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-error-analysis-what-are-its-limitations">What is error analysis? What are its limitations?</h3>
<p>Error Analysis (EA) is the first approach to the study of SLA which includes an internal focus on learners’ creative ability to construct language. It is based on the description and analysis of actual learner errors in L2, rather than on idealized linguistic structures attributed to native speakers of L1 and L2 (as in CA).</p>
<h3 id="what-is-acquisition-learning-hypothesis-made-in-the-monitor-model">What is Acquisition-Learning Hypothesis made in the Monitor Model?</h3>
<p>Acquisition-Learning Hypothesis. There is a distinction to be made between acquisition and learning. Acquisition is subconscious, and involves the innate language acquisition device which accounts for children’s L1. Learning is conscious and is exemplified by the L2 learning which takes place in many classroom contexts.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-input-hypothesis">What is Input Hypothesis?</h3>
<p>Input Hypothesis. Language acquisition takes place because there is comprehensible input. If input is understood, and if there is enough of it, the necessary grammar is automatically provided.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-interlanguage">What is interlanguage?</h3>
<p>Interlanguage: the intermediate states (or interim grammars) of a learner’s language as it moves toward the target L2. </p>
<h3 id="define-the-following-terms-competence-performance-principles-parameters.">Define the following terms: competence, performance; principles, parameters.</h3>
<p>Linguists emphasize the characteristics of the differences and similarities in the languages that are being learned, and the linguistic competence (underlying knowledge) and linguistic performance (actual production) of learners at various stages of acquisition.</p>
<p>linguistic competence: The underlying knowledge that speakers/hearers have of a language. Chomsky distinguishes this from linguistic performance. linguistic performance: The use of language knowledge in actual production</p>
<p>Interlanguage: the intermediate states (or interim grammars) of a learner’s language as it moves toward the target L2. </p>
<h3 id="what-is-fossilization">What is fossilization?</h3>
<p>Fossilization: cessation of learning/IL development in some aspects before they reach target language norms, in spite of continuing L2 input and passage of time. Because age of learning, factors of social identity and communicative need.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-language-learning-viewed-in-the-connectionist-approaches-to-language-learning">How is language learning viewed in the Connectionist approaches to language learning?</h3>
<p>Connectionist approaches focus on the increasing strength of associations between stimuli and responses rather than on the inferred abstraction of “rules” or on restructuring. Indeed, from a connectionist perspective learning essentially is change in the strength of these connections.</p>
<h3 id="comprehension-of-written-or-spoken-language-involves-both-bottom-up-and-top-down-processing.">Comprehension of written or spoken language involves both bottom-up and top-down processing.</h3>
<p>Bottom-up processing requires prior knowledge of the language system (i.e. vocabulary, morphology, phonology, syntax, and discourse structure) and interpretation of physical (graphic and auditory) cues.</p>
<p>Top-down processing can compensate for linguistic limitations to some extent by allowing learners to guess the meaning of words they have not encountered before, and to make some sense out of larger chunks of written and oral text. For both L1 and L2 speakers, top-down processing utilizes prior knowledge of content, context, and culture, which were shown in 6.1 to be essential components of communicative competence.</p>
<h3 id="zpd-mediation-scaffolding">ZPD, mediation, scaffolding</h3>
<p>Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). This is an area of potential development, where the learner can achieve that potential only with assistance. One way in which others help the learner in language development within the ZPD is through scaffolding. This includes the “vertical constructions” mentioned above as a type of modified interaction between NSs and NNSs, in which experts commonly provide learners with chunks of talk that the learners can then use to express concepts which are beyond their independent means. This According to S-C Theory, learning occurs when simple innate mental activities are transformed into “higher order,” more complex mental functions. This transformation typically involves symbolic mediation, which is a link between a person’s current mental state and higher order functions that is provided primarily by language. This is considered the usual route to learning, whether what is being learned is language itself or some other area of knowledge. The results of learning through mediation include learners’ having heightened awareness of their own mental abilities and more control over their thought processes.</p>
<h3 id="according-to-the-interaction-hypothesis-how-do-modifications-and-collaborative-efforts-facilitate-sla">According to the Interaction Hypothesis, how do modifications and collaborative  efforts facilitate SLA?</h3>
<p>According to claims made in the Interaction Hypothesis, the modifications and collaborative efforts that take place in social interaction facilitate SLA because they contribute to the accessibility of input for mental processing: “negotiation for meaning, and especially negotiation work that triggers interactional adjustments by the NS or more competent interlocutor, facilitates acquisition because it connects input, internal learner capacities, particularly selective attention, and output in productive ways”</p>
<h3 id="how-is-interaction-viewed-in-sociocultural-theory">How is interaction viewed in Sociocultural Theory?</h3>
<p>Sociocultural (S-C) Theory (Vygotsky 1962, 1978). interaction not only facilitates language learning but is a causative force in acquisition. considering interaction as an essential force rather than as merely a helpful condition for learning.</p>
<h3 id="output-hypothesis">output hypothesis</h3>
<p>The output hypothesis claims that the act of producing language (speaking or writing) constitutes, under certain circumstances, part of the process of second language learning. Three functions of output in second language learning:</p>
<p>Accessibility Hierarchy A continuum of relative clause types such that the presence of one type implies the presence of other types higher on the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Affective Filter Part of the Monitor Model. The claim is that affect is an important part of the learning process and that one has a “raised” or “lowered” affective filter. The latter leads to better learning.</p>
<p>attention The concentration of mental powers.</p>
<p>automaticity The degree of routinized control that one has over linguistic knowledge.</p>
<p>behaviorism A school of psychology that bases learning on a stimulus— response paradigm.</p>
<p>comprehensible input Originally formulated as part of the Monitor Model, this concept refers to the understandable input that learners need for learning. Input that is slightly more advanced than the learner’s current level of grammatical knowledge.</p>
<p>connectionism An approach that assumes that learning takes place based on the extraction of regularities from the input. (See also emergentism.)</p>
<p>contrastive analysis A way of comparing two languages to determine similarities and dissimilarities.</p>
<p>Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis The prediction that similarities between two languages do not require learning and that the differences are what need to be learned.</p>
<p>Creative Construction Hypothesis The proposal that child second language learners construct rules of the second language on the basis of innate mechanisms.</p>
<p>declarative knowledge Knowledge that learners have about something. This information is relatively accessible to conscious awareness. (See also procedural knowledge.)</p>
<p>error analysis A procedure for analyzing second language data that begins with the errors learners make and then attempts to explain them.</p>
<p>explicit knowledge Knowledge about language that involves awareness. (See also declarative knowledge, explicit learning, implicit knowledge, implicit learning, procedural knowledge.)</p>
<p>explicit learning Acquisition of language that involves deliberate hypothesis testing as learners search for structure. (See also declarative knowledge; explicit knowledge; implicit knowledge; implicit learning; procedural knowledge.)</p>
<p>feedback An intervention in which information is provided to a learner that a prior utterance is correct or incorrect. (See also corrective feedback.)</p>
<p>fossilization The cessation of learning. Permanent plateaus that learners reach resulting from no change in some or all of their interlanguage forms. (See also interlanguage; stabilization.)</p>
<p>implicit knowledge Knowledge about language that does not involve awareness of that knowledge. (See also declarative knowledge; explicit learning; explicit knowledge; implicit learning; procedural knowledge.)</p>
<p>implicit learning Acquisition of knowledge about the underlying structure of a complex stimulus environment without doing so consciously. (See also explicit knowledge; explicit learning; implicit knowledge.)</p>
<p>incidental vocabulary learning Learning that takes place with an explicit focus on meaning as opposed to having an explicit goal being the learning of new words.</p>
<p>input enhancement A technique that attempts to make parts of the input salient.</p>
<p>intake That part of the language input that is internalized by the learner.</p>
<p>interference The use of the first language (or other languages known) in a second language context when the resulting second language form is incorrect. (See also language transfer; negative transfer.)</p>
<p>interlanguage The language produced by a nonnative speaker of a 518 G LO S S A RY language (i.e., a learner’s output). Refers to the systematic knowledge underlying learners’ production. interlanguage transfer The influence of one L2 over another in instances where there are multiple languages acquired after the L1.</p>
<p>Language Acquisition Device (LAD) A language faculty that constrains and guides the acquisition process.</p>
<p>language transfer The use of the first language (or other languages known) in a second language context. (See also cross-linguistic influence; facilitation; interference; negative transfer; positive transfer.)</p>
<p>metalinguistic knowledge What one knows (or thinks one knows) about the language. It is to be differentiated from what one does in using language.</p>
<p>Monitor Model A model of second language acquisition based on the concept that learners have two systems (acquisition and learning) and that the learned system monitors the acquired system.</p>
<p>negative transfer The use of the first language (or other languages known) in a second language context resulting in a nontarget-like second language form. (See also interference; language transfer; positive transfer.)</p>
<p>negotiation of meaning The attempt made in conversation to clarify a lack of understanding.</p>
<p>Poverty of the Stimulus A proposal made within the confines of Universal Grammar that input alone is not sufficiently specific to allow a child to attain the complexities of the adult grammar. (See also Universal Grammar.)</p>
<p>procedural knowledge Knowledge that relates to cognitive skills that involve sequencing information. This information is relatively inaccessible. (See also declarative knowledge.) Processability Theory A theory that proposes that production and comprehension of second language forms only takes place to the extent that they can be handled by the linguistic processor. Understanding how the processor functions allows one to understand developmental paths.</p>
<p>recasts Reformulations of an incorrect utterance that maintain the original’s meaning. restructuring Changes or reorganization of one’s grammatical knowledge.</p>
<p>Sociocultural Theory A theory based on work by the Russian psychologist Vygotsky that considers knowledge/learning arises from a social context. Learning, being socially mediated, comes from faceto-face interaction. Knowledge is internalized from learners jointly constructing knowledge in dyadic interactions.</p>
<p>stabilization The plateaus that learners reach when there is little change in some or all of their interlanguage forms (See also fossilization; interlanguage.)</p>
<p>Universal Grammar A set of innate principles common to all languages.</p>
<p>U-shaped learning Learning whereby early forms appear to be correct, followed by a period of incorrect forms, with a final stage of correct forms.</p>
<p>working memory Memory that involves storage capacity and processing capacity.</p>
<h1 id="emergentism-and-usage-based-theories">Emergentism and usage-based theories</h1>
<p>Emergentism is a theory within cognitive psychology that attempts to account for human learning and knowledge. <strong>Central to the theory is that all human learning uses the same general architecture for knowledge and performance development be it language, tennis, or assembly-line work.</strong></p>
<p>In contrast to linguistic theory that posits a Universal Grammar that is unique to language and is responsible for the nature of language, emergentism would claim <strong>there is nothing special about language.</strong></p>
<p>What is more, the theory says that <strong>all learning and representation (knowledge) in the mind/brain is sensitive to frequency.</strong> So, those things that are more frequent in the environment or those things with which a person has more frequent experience are more likely to be learned before others.</p>
<p>At the same time, more frequent things are likely to have more robust representations in the mind/brain. Emergentism is aligned with what are called usage-based theories because such theories rely on people’s experience with their environment and how this is indicated in their performance. Performance is central to Emergentism in that observable behaviors are taken to be indicators of what exists in representation and how robustly it is represented. Applied to language, emergentism would suggest that something like sentence structure is a result of frequencies of occurrence in the input that people are exposed to. As the reader might surmise, <strong>a central idea within emergentism is that the human mind/brain is a statistical tabulator par excellence</strong>, and although other factors may come into play in how important a piece of linguistic data is, human knowledge and performance with that knowledge is a direct result of experience with the environment. There is nothing special in the mind/brain that constrains or regulates language.</p>
<p>Emergentism does have problems, however, in accounting for the poverty of the stimulus problem. Within the theory, there is no real way to explain how people come to know more than what they are exposed to. Because the theory relies heavily on frequency in the input and general learning architecture, it cannot explain why people know that certain kinds of sentence permutations are impossible.</p>
<p>The Declarative/Procedural Model</p>
<h2 id="complexity-theorydynamic-systems"><strong>Complexity Theory/Dynamic Systems</strong></h2>
<p>complexity (in any domain, not just language) arises as a result of the interaction of various individuals or components.</p>
<p><strong>Sociocultural Theory</strong></p>
<p><strong>The basics</strong></p>
<p>Sociocultural Theory, based on the work of the Russian psychologist Vygotsky, argues that the development of <strong>human cognitive functions derives from social interactions and that through participation in social activities individuals are drawn into the use of these functions.</strong> The theory focuses not only on how adults and peers influence individual learning, but also on how <strong>cultural beliefs and attitudes</strong> impact how instruction and learning take place. The central constructs of the theory are: mediation; the zone of proximal development (ZPD); and verbal thought. <strong>Language learning is a socially mediated process and language is a cultural artifact that mediates social and psychological activities.</strong> <strong>Mediation refers to the idea that humans possess certain cultural tools, such as language, literacy, numeracy, and others, that they purposefully use to control and interact with their environment.</strong></p>
<p>The ZPD is a difficult concept to articulate and is often subject to misinterpretation, but to summarize here, the ZPD refers to the distance between a learner’s current ability to independently solve problems and the level of potential development present when guided by more capable persons. According to Vygotsky, learning occurs in this zone and it is achieved through the cooperation of experts and novices working together. Applied to language, learning concerns the development of language function and mental function, along with the combination of language and thought. Generally speaking, acquisition includes the process in which the low level external or social speech develops into the highest level inner speech or verbal thought.</p>

<h1 id="mediation">Mediation</h1>
<p>Human activity (including cognitive activity) is mediated by what are known as symbolic artifacts (higher-level cultural tools) such as language and literacy and by material artifacts. These artifacts mediate the relationship between humans and the social and material world around us.</p>
<p>Within sociocultural theory, humans use symbols as tools to mediate psychological activity and to control our psychological processes. This control is voluntary and allows us to attend to certain things, to plan, and to think rationally. The primary tool that humans have available is language and it is a tool that allows us to connect to our environment (both physical and social). Language gives humans the power to go beyond the immediate environment and to think about and talk about events and objects that are far removed both physically and temporally.</p>
