        <h2 id="vendler-classes"><strong>Vendler classes</strong></h2>
<p>The philosopher Zeno Vendler described types of verbs based on their inher ent <strong>ASPECTUAL</strong> differences. The classes he distinguished can be broken down <strong>COMPONENTIALLY</strong> according to three dichotomies, as shown in the table below. Vendler’s classification remains one of the most popular in describing types of <strong>SITUATIONS</strong>.</p>
<p>While Vendler intended his categories as categories of verb meanings, it has since been noted that <strong>TELICITY</strong> in particular is sensitive to the <strong>ARGUMENTS</strong> of the verb. For example, in the table the predicate sing is classified as an activity, but when it is joined with a <strong>BOUNDED</strong> noun phrase like three songs, it is an achievement, since the singing of three songs has a conclusion – at the end of the third song.</p>
<h2 id="denotational-versus-representational"><strong>Denotational versus representational</strong></h2>
<p>Semantic approaches can be divided into two main types. <strong>Denotational</strong> approaches attempt descriptions of the relation between language and the world – that is, between words or other expressions and the things or situations that they refer to (see <strong>DENOTATION</strong>). <strong>Representational</strong> approaches try to model how meaning is represented in the human mind – in other words, they are <strong>mentalistic</strong> in nature.</p>
<h2 id="sense"><strong>Sense</strong></h2>
<p>The term <strong>sense</strong> is one of two aspects of meaning, the other being <strong>REFERENCE</strong>. While reference is what an expression points to in the world, sense is the semantic aspect of meaning – the definitional properties that determine which things are referred to when an expression is used. <strong>Sense</strong> can also refer to a <strong>DEFINITION</strong> in a dictionary.</p>
<h2 id="semiotic-triangle"><strong>Semiotic triangle</strong></h2>
<p>For the purposes of linguistics, we can isolate three particularly important factors relevant to the study of meaning: the psychology of speakers, which creates and interprets language, the referent of the language expression as projected by the language user’s psychology, and the linguistic expression itself: these three points constitute the semiotic triangle.</p>
<h2 id="sense-reference-denotation-and-connotation">Sense, reference, denotation and connotation</h2>
<p>referent on any one occasion of use,</p>
<p>denotation: the set of all its referents</p>
<p>sense: the abstract, general meaning which can be translated from one language to another, paraphrased, or defined in a dictionary.</p>
<p>Connotation names those aspects of meaning which do not affect a word’s sense, reference or denotation, but which have to do with secondary factors such as its emotional force, its level of formality, its character as a euphemism, etc.</p>
<h2 id="explanations-of-meaning-in-terms-of-meanings-are-circular-and-four-ways-of-breaking-the-circle">Explanations of meaning in terms of meanings are circular and Four ways of breaking the circle</h2>
<p>All definitions of meaning in language, therefore, are ultimately circular because they use one kind of meaning to explain another.</p>
<p>There are four important answers to the question ‘what is meaning?’: the referential/denotational theory of meaning, the conceptual theory of meaning, the brain states theory and the use theory. We do not have to categorically choose between these theories. Instead, recognizing that the notion of meaning in linguistics is a way of talking about the factors which explain language use, we can see referents, concepts, brain states and uses as all relevant to this task.</p>
<h2 id="truth">Truth</h2>
<p>From this perspective, truth that is known before or without experience has traditionally been called <strong>a priori</strong>. This <strong>a priori truth</strong> is contrasted with <strong>a posteriori truth</strong>: truth which can only be known on the basis of empirical testing. Another related concept is Leibniz’s distinction between <strong>necessary truths</strong>, which cannot be denied without forcing a contradiction, for example the arithmetical statement Two and two make four, and <strong>contingent truths</strong> which can be contradicted, depending on the facts, for example the sentence The dodo is extinct. If someone unexpectedly found a dodo in a forest on Mauritius, this latter sentence would become false. It is difficult, on the other hand, to imagine circumstances in which Two and two make four would unexpectedly become false. This is similar to our a priori/a posteriori distinction but comes at truth from another viewpoint: not in terms of what the speaker knows but in terms of what the world is like. We can say that it is hard to think how our sentence about two and two making four could not be true without changing our view of the present facts of the world. From this perspective a sentence like 4.40 is also necessarily true and a contradiction like 4.41 is necessarily false. In another, related terminology tautologies like 4.39 are <strong>analytic</strong> while a sentence like My father is a sailor is <strong>synthetic</strong>. <strong>Analytic</strong> statements are those where the truth follows from the meaning relations within the sentence, regardless of any relationship with the world, while a <strong>synthetically</strong> true statement is true because it accords with the facts of the world.</p>
<h2 id="analytic">Analytic</h2>
<p>Analytic PROPOSITIONS are those that require no external verification, which is to say that their truth or falsity can be established by examining only their linguistic matter and internal logic, rather than appealing to our senses in order to verify the claims they describe. Consider, for example, the following: No dead person is alive.</p>
<h2 id="truth-1">Truth</h2>
<p>From this perspective, truth that is known before or without experience has traditionally been called a priori. This a priori truth is contrasted with a posteriori truth: truth which, as in our examples 4.17 and 4.18 earlier, can only be known on the basis of empirical testing. Another related concept is Leibniz’s distinction between necessary truths, which cannot be denied without forcing a contradiction, for example the arithmetical statement Two and two make four, and contingent truths which can be contradicted, depending on the facts, for example the sentence The dodo is extinct.</p>
<h2 id="presuppose-presupposition">Presuppose, presupposition</h2>
<p>A presupposition is a proposition that must be supposed to be true in order for another proposition to be judged true or false. For example, The king of France is bald presupposes the proposition that ‘there is a king of France.’ Unlike ENTAILMENTS, the presupposition remains the same when the sentence is negated. So, The king of France is not bald still presupposes that ‘there is a king of France.’</p>
<h2 id="anaphor-anaphora-anaphoric">Anaphor, anaphora, anaphoric</h2>
<p>In anaphora, a linguistic expression (called an anaphor or anaphoric pronoun) is understood to have the same REFERENCE as another linguistic expression (its antecedent), which typically precedes it in the same sentence or in the earlier discourse.</p>
<h2 id="anomalous-anomaly">Anomalous, anomaly</h2>
<p>A semantically anomalous linguistic expression is one that has an abnormal meaning or fails to make sense, despite being grammatically well-formed.</p>
<p>Semantic anomalies are sometimes accounted for as violations of SELECTIONAL RESTRICTIONS that words place on other words that they occur with. Thus The telephone ate my gingerbread is anomalous because the verb eat is restricted to only occur with subjects that refer to animate beings – unless the expression is to be interpreted FIGURATIVELY.</p>
<h2 id="antecedent">Antecedent</h2>
<p>An antecedent is something that comes before something else. In reference to ANAPHORA, it refers to an earlier expression to which a pronoun CO-REFERS.</p>
<h2 id="argument">Argument</h2>
<p>In a PROPOSITION or SENTENCE, (semantic) arguments are the participants in the EVENT or STATE expressed by the PREDICATE.</p>
<p>Argument In a PROPOSITION or SENTENCE, (semantic) arguments are the participants in the EVENT or STATE expressed by the PREDICATE. Within a sentence/proposition, arguments play particular roles, called SEMANTIC ROLES. The number and type of arguments that a predicate requires and their syntactic realization is known as argument structure.</p>
<h2 id="aspect-aspectual">Aspect, aspectual</h2>
<p>The SITUATIONS described by PROPOSITIONS can take place in time in different ways. The internal organization of a situation with relation to time – that is, how the situation unfolds in time or the temporal perspective taken on the situation – is its aspect as opposed to its TENSE, which is the when of the situation.</p>
<h2 id="causative-alternation">causative alternation</h2>
<p>In linguistics, causative alternation is a phenomenon in which certain verbs that express a change of state (or a change of degree) can be used transitively or intransitively. A causatively alternating verb, such as "open", has both a transitive meaning ("I opened the door") and an intransitive meaning ("The door opened"). When causatively alternating verbs are used transitively they are called causatives since, in the transitive use of the verb, the subject is causing the action denoted by the intransitive version. When causatively alternating verbs are used intransitively, they are referred to as anticausatives or inchoatives because the intransitive variant describes a situation in which the theme participant (in this case "the door") undergoes a change of state, becoming, for example, "opened".</p>
<h2 id="deictic-deixis">Deictic, deixis</h2>
<p>Deixis refers to the phenomenon where the meaning of some linguistic item relies inherently on the extralinguistic CONTEXT. Thus understanding deictic expressions like that book, here, yesterday or I depends on knowing where the utterance is spoken, when it is spoken and who is speaking.</p>
<h2 id="demonstrative">Demonstrative</h2>
<p>Demonstratives are expressions such as this, that, those and these. A distinction can be made between demonstrative determiners and demonstrative pronouns – the former occur with a noun in a noun phrase (this book, those boxes), while the latter substitute for a whole noun phrase and therefore stand alone (This is nice.).</p>
<h2 id="denotational-versus-representational-1">Denotational versus representational</h2>
<p>Semantic approaches can be divided into two main types. Denotational approaches attempt descriptions of the relation between language and the world – that is, between words or other expressions and the things or situations that they refer to (see DENOTATION). Representational approaches try to model how meaning is represented in the human mind – in other words, they are mentalistic in nature. Denotational approaches tend to derive from philosophy and mathematical logic (and thus FORMAL SEMANTIC approaches are often denotational), but much of the modern linguistic tradition in semantics is more representational than denotational – for example, COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS, CONCEPTUAL SEMANTICS and NATURAL SEMANTIC METALANGUAGE approaches are all representational.</p>
<h2 id="encyclopaedic-meaning">Encyclopaedic meaning</h2>
<p>Encyclopaedic meaning is general world knowledge, known by virtue of our experience of the world.</p>
<h2 id="entailment">Entailment</h2>
<p>Entailment is the PROPOSITIONAL RELATION in which if one PROPOSITION is true, then it is always the case that the related proposition is true. This can be stated as the MATERIAL CONDITIONAL</p>
<h2 id="evidential-evidentiality">Evidential, evidentiality</h2>
<p>Evidentiality is a type of MODALITY that indicates the speaker’s source of the knowledge that is expressed in a PROPOSITION or SENTENCE – for instance, through personal observation, by hearsay or by inferring it from other knowledge. Languages like Turkish have morphological markers of evidentiality, but in English it can only be marked by lexical means (e.g. apparently) or through constructions such as be supposed to: Daisy’s stew is supposed to be delicious (i.e. ‘I have heard that it is, but I do not have experience of it myself’).</p>
<h2 id="extension">Extension</h2>
<p>The extension of an expression is the set of all potential REFERENTS of the expression with respect to some world or MODEL.</p>
<h2 id="inchoative">Inchoative</h2>
<p>Inchoative Verbs (or PREDICATES) whose meanings involve ‘beginning’ or ‘becoming’ are referred to as inchoative (also inceptive) from the Latin verb for ‘begin’. Inchoative verbs describe a change of state or a beginning of having a state. For example redden means ‘become red’ and open denotes the change from being closed to not being closed. CAUSATIVE verbs can also be considered to be inchoative.</p>
<h2 id="inclusion-inclusive">Inclusion, inclusive</h2>
<p>The terms inclusion and inclusive can apply to a number of semantic phenomena. In SEMANTIC (particularly LEXICAL) RELATIONS, a relation of inclusion is when the EXTENSION of one term is a proper subset of the extension of another. For example, the things denoted by kitten are also among the things denoted by cat (see HYPONYM). Proper inclusion is when a SUBORDINATE CATEGORY is wholly contained within another, SUPERORDINATE category. The set of blue pens is properly included within the set of pens because there is nothing that is in the set of blue pens that is not also in the set of pens.</p>
<h2 id="lexeme">Lexeme</h2>
<p>A lexeme (cf. LEXICAL ITEM) is a unit of language that is represented in the LEXICON. Like other linguistic -eme terms, lexeme refers to an abstraction from the actual spoken or written language – that is, it refers to the word as it is represented in the mind, rather than in the mouth or on the page.</p>
<h2 id="lexicon">Lexicon</h2>
<p>Traditionally, the lexicon is a collection of information about a language’s LEXEMES, that is, the expressions that are learnt by the language’s users, rather than derived anew each time they are used. The term lexicon can refer to the following: a) a dictionary, especially a dictionary of a classical language; or b) the vocabulary of a language (also known as lexis); or c) a particular language user’s knowledge of her/his own vocabulary, as stored in her/his mind – the mental lexicon.</p>
<h2 id="meaning">Meaning</h2>
<p>Linguistic meaning is, of course, the object of study in semantics. However, meaning is rarely used as a technical term in semantic study because of its POLYSEMY and generality. For example, it may be used to refer to an expression’s DEFINITION or SENSE, but it may instead be used to include non-denotational aspects of meaning, such as CONNOTATION, or to the particular INTERPRETATION of the expression’s REFERENCE in a particular CONTEXT. Where it is used, it is usually because a distinction between sense and reference is not needed in the particular discussion or it is used as a synonym for sense or interpretation.</p>
<h2 id="metalanguage">Metalanguage</h2>
<p>A metalanguage is a system used for describing a language without using that language itself. A metalanguage resolves the inevitable circularity that arises if one, for instance, uses English to describe the semantics of English. One could, in principle, use one natural language to describe another (e.g. Finnish to describe Polish). However, this has the problem that the meanings of the object language (the language being described) would not necessarily translate in an equivalent way into the other natural language used as a metalanguage. An ideal metalanguage should provide a complete and unambiguous description of the object language.</p>
<h2 id="modality-modal-verbs">Modality, modal verbs</h2>
<p>In linguistics, modality refers to the expression of a speaker’s attitude towards a PROPOSITION. This involves notions such as obligation, permission, possibility, necessity and ability. In English these notions are typically expressed via the modal verbs may, must, can, will, shall, might, could and should, or semiGRAMMATICALIZED expressions such as have to, need to or had better. Expressions of MOOD may also indicate a type of modality distinction – that between the reality and irreality of a proposition.</p>
<p>Modality can be divided into different types and, within those types, into different degrees. The most established distinction of modality types is that between deontic and epistemic modality. Deontic modality involves a duty, obligation, permission or (when negated) prohibition being imposed on someone or something. Different degrees of deontic modality are shown below: Tim must take the dog out for a walk. (obligation) Tim should take the dog out for a walk. (weaker obligation) Tim may/can take the dog out for a walk. (permission) Epistemic modality, on the other hand, relates to the speaker’s judgement of how probable the truth of the proposition is, based on some available evidence.</p>
<h2 id="montague-grammar">Montague grammar</h2>
<p>The grammar presents a COMPOSITIONAL means of representing linguistic meaning through the use of a formal system of representation (LAMBDA CALCULUS) combined with set and type theories from mathematics.</p>
<h2 id="ontological-category-ontology">Ontological category, ontology</h2>
<p>Ontology is the philosophical field that attempts to organize everything that exists into a limited number of general CATEGORIES.</p>
<h2 id="polarity-item">Polarity item</h2>
<p>A polarity item is a LEXEME that is sensitive to the POLARITY of the constituent to which it belongs. For instance, the determiner any is a negative polarity item that can only occur in negated clauses, while the positive polarity item some must occur in affirmative clauses</p>
<h2 id="predicate">Predicate</h2>
<p>In semantics, predicate refers to the part of a PROPOSITION that expresses the relation or property that is being ascribed to some entities, ARGUMENTS.</p>
<h2 id="presuppose-presupposition-1">Presuppose, presupposition</h2>
<p>A presupposition is a proposition that must be supposed to be true in order for another proposition to be judged true or false. For example, The king of France is bald presupposes the proposition that ‘there is a king of France.’ Unlike ENTAILMENTS, the presupposition remains the same when the sentence is negated. So, The king of France is not bald still presupposes that ‘there is a king of France.’</p>
<h2 id="primitive-semantic">Primitive, semantic</h2>
<p>A primitive or atomic unit is one that cannot be broken down or defined further and thus forms the most basic unit of analysis. In semantics, the notion of primitives is particularly important in COMPONENTIAL ANALYSIS, which assumes that the meanings of linguistic items are built out of smaller units of meaning, meaning components.</p>
<h2 id="pronouns">Pronouns</h2>
<p>Personal pronouns like me, she and they have DEFINITE reference, as do the DEMONSTRATIVE pronouns this, that, these and those. In English, indefinite pronouns are often similar in form to indefinite QUANTIFIERS – for example, one or some in I want some.</p>
<p>Pronouns are often used ANAPHORICALLY, which is to say that they refer to something that was mentioned previously in the discourse. But pronouns are also used for DEIXIS, which involves reference to something in the extralinguistic context. An example of this would be when a speaker says That was there while pointing first to an object and then a location.</p>
<h2 id="proper-name-proper-noun">Proper name, proper noun</h2>
<p>A proper name, or proper noun, is a nominal expression that denotes the same individual (or particular set of individuals) every time it is used. This is opposed to a COMMON NOUN, which indicates a type of thing, and therefore can be used to denote different individuals each time it is used.</p>
<h2 id="proposition">Proposition</h2>
<p>A proposition may be defined as the meaning of a SENTENCE that makes a statement about some state of affairs. As such, a proposition has a TRUTH VALUE; it can be either true or false. A proposition is independent of the linguistic structure used to express it, which is to say that the same proposition can be expressed by different sentences.</p>
<h2 id="referring-expression">Referring expression</h2>
<p>A referring expression is an expression that REFERS in a context to an individual or set of individuals. In natural language, this would usually be expressed as a NOUN phrase, but not all uses of noun phrases refer. For example, in Noam Chomsky is a linguist, Noam Chomsky refers to a particular individual, but a linguist does not refer to any particular linguist, but rather describes the PROPERTY of being a linguist.</p>
<h2 id="selectional-restriction">Selectional restriction</h2>
<p>Selectional (or selection) restrictions are constraints that determine which co-occurrences of words or meanings of words are semantically well-formed, rather than ANOMALOUS or abnormal. Selectional restrictions are generally considered to be separate from grammatical constraints such as that transitive verbs must take noun phrases as their objects.</p>
<p>One meaning of vagueness refers to the underspecification or generality of SENSE. For example, the word cousin can refer to either a male or a female, or an infant or a pensioner and it therefore has a sense that is vague or underspecified with respect to gender and age. This meaning of vagueness contrasts with AMBIGUITY, where a linguistic form has multiple distinct senses (e.g. light ‘not dark’; ‘not heavy’ or bug ‘an insect’; ‘a listening device’).</p>
<h2 id="valency">Valency</h2>
<p>Valency refers to the number of ARGUMENTS a VERB requires in order to express a complete PROPOSITION. Valency corresponds to the classification of PREDICATES into one-, two- and three-place predicates.</p>
<h2 id="middle-voice">Middle voice</h2>
<p>Some languages also have a further grammatical category of middle voice. Middle voice typically serves to emphasize that the argument that occurs in the subject position is affected by the event expressed by the verb. In English, middle voice occurs in a very limited class of examples such as the ones below: These oranges peel very easily. The tickets aren’t selling that well. Like passives, these examples involve the promotion of a non-AGENT participant into the subject position, but English does not have any special morphological marking of middle voice.</p>
<h2 id="zeugma">Zeugma</h2>
<p>In semantics, a zeugma (or syllepsis) is a linguistic construction where a single constituent is related to two different semantic interpretations, in a way that gives rise to a semantic ANOMALY.</p>
<p>For the zeugmatic, anomalous reading to arise, the two interpretations that are evoked simultaneously need to be semantically distinct. Therefore, the possibility of constructing a zeugmatic sentence provides a way of testing whether particular readings of a linguistic form are AMBIGUOUS (POLYSEMOUS or HOMONYMOUS) or just VAGUE.</p>
