Acoustic phonetics The branch of phonetics that specifies the acoustic characteristics associated with each speech sound. Acquired dyslexia A form of reading disability in a previously literate person who has sustained brain damage. Active processing A collection of activities that includes relating new information to information we have in permanent memory, asking questions of the material, and writing summaries or outlines of the material. Active voice A sentence in which the surface structure subject is also the deep structure or logical subject of the sentence, such as The woman scolded the child. Addition A speech error in which linguistic material is added, as in I didn’t explain this clarefully enough [carefully enough]. Affricate A consonant that begins with complete closure of the vocal tract followed by gradual release of air pressure, such as the ch in church. Agent The thematic or semantic role corresponding to an individual who performs a given action, such as the manager in The manager opened the store. Agrammatic speech Speech in which there is a lack of grammatical structure, such as the absence of grammatical morphemes and function words. Agrammatism See agrammatic speech. Agraphia An aphasia characterized by the inability to write. Alexia An aphasia characterized by the inability to comprehend written or printed words.

American Sign Language (ASL) The form of sign language used in the United States. It is a complete language distinct from oral languages. Anaphor A linguistic expression that refers back to prior information in discourse. Anaphoric reference A form of reference cohesion in which one linguistic expression refers back to prior information in discourse. Angular gyrus Believed to serve as an association area in the brain that connects one region with another; particularly important for the association of visual stimuli with linguistic symbols. Damage to the angular gyrus leads to both alexia and agraphia. Animacy A semantic feature denoting whether an object is alive. Anomalous suspense In narrative comprehension, the experience of suspense when the reader already knows how a story will turn out. Antecedent Prior information in discourse. Anticipation A speech error in which a later word or sound takes the place of an earlier one. Anticipatory coarticulation Type of coarticulation in which the shape of the vocal tract for a given speech sound is influenced by upcoming sounds. Anticipatory retracing Selfrepair in which the speaker traces back to some point prior to an error. Previously correct material is repeated along with the corrected material. See also fresh start and instant repair. Aphasia A language or speech disorder caused by brain damage. Arbitrariness A feature of language in which there is no direct resemblance between words and their referents.

Aspiration A puff of air that accompanies the production of certain speech sounds. Aspiration is phonemic in some languages but not in English. Assertion A communicative act in which a person draws the attention of another person to a particular object—for example, a child showing a toy to an adult as if to say This is mine. Assertions may be made through words or gestures. Assimilation A phonological process in which one speech sound is replaced by another that is similar to sounds elsewhere in the utterance. Associative chain theory A theory favored by behaviorists that explains the formulation of a sentence as a chain of associations between the individual words in the sentence. Attemptsuppressing signal A cue given by a speaker to indicate to a listener that he or she is not finished. Attributive relations Relations between words that indicate the attributes of a given word, such as round as an attribute for ball. Auditory level A level of speech perception in which the speech signal is represented in terms of frequency, intensity, and temporal attributes. Automaticity A property of cognitive processes that do not require any processing capacity. Automatic process An activity that does not require any processing capacity. Autonoetic consciousness A form of consciousness in which one experiences time, as past, present, or future. Auxiliary verb A ‘‘helping verb.’’ A verb such as is, do, or can used in conjunction with the main verb in a sentence, such as Kim is gardening this afternoon. Baby talk See motherese.

Bound morpheme A unit of meaning that exists only when combined or bound to a free morpheme. Bridging A process in which the listener or reader draws inferences to build a ‘‘bridge’’ between the current utterance and preceding utterances. Broca’s aphasia An aphasia characterized by deficits in language production. Also called expressive aphasia. Broca’s area A brain region in the frontal lobe of the left hemisphere. Damage to this region leads to Broca’s aphasia. Bystanders Individuals who are openly present but not part of a conversation. Cataphoric reference A form of reference cohesion in which one linguistic expression refers to information yet to be introduced in discourse. Categorical perception The inability to discriminate sounds within a phonemic category. Categorysize effect The fact that it takes longer to semantically verify a statement of the form An A is a B if B is a larger semantic category.

Conjunctive cohesion A form of cohesion in which we express a relationship between sentences or phrases by using conjunctions such as and, or, and but. Connected discourse See discourse.

Consonant A speech sound in which the vocal tract is partially or fully closed during production. Constituent A grammatical unit such as a noun or verb phrase. Constraintbased model A model of sentence comprehension in which we simultaneously use all available information (semantic, syntactic, contextual, and so forth) in our initial parsing of a sentence.
